    <div>A table is a great way to organize information in your page
        for example a class list, or league standings; basically any
        data that can be organized into a series of rows and columns
        where you might want to preserve spacing.
    </div> 
    <div>To define your table, we use a series of nested elements:
        <ol>
            <li>There is a parent element of &lt;table&gt;</li>
            <li>There is a first child element to define a row &lt;tr&gt;</li>
            <li>Within each row, there are child elements for individual
                cells &lt;tr&gt;</li>     
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div>Consider the example below:</div>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>el1</td>
            <td>el2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2nd row cell 1</td>
            <td>2nd row, cell 2</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <div>
        Note that table elements can also be styled (check the style
        section in the head)
    </div>
</body>
