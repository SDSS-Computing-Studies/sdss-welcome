        <p>Forms are what we refer to as elements that can create input.  They generally consist of buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, drop down menus (select boxes),
        and text input fields.  There are also hidden input elements, and elements that will only accept phone numbers, or emails, or dates, but these are just
        really variations of input fields:</p>
        <p>Note that form elements do not have to be container tags.  In fact, with new javascript and css, they actually don't even have to be
            form elements, but we continue to use form tags as they are a good starting point that helps us keep the names and functions associated.
        </p>
        <input type="date" value="This is a text input"><br>
        <input type="button" value="This is a button"><br>
        <input type="checkbox">This is a checkbox.<br>
        <input type="radio">This is a radio button<br>
        <select>
            <option>Select box</option>
            <option>option2</option>
        </select><br>
        <button>A button can also be a container tag</button>
        <textarea>This is a text area (multiple line input)</textarea>
        <p>Note form that elements can be styled as well</p>
        <input type="button" value="Styled button" class="stbut"><br>

        <h5>Assignment</h5>
        <p>Create a form to receive some data from a user.  Don't be too concerned about the layout, but you want to make sure that you are receiving
            all the information that you might need.  Some suggestions:
            <ol>
                <li>A page to add your dog to the database for a city dog registry</li>
                <li>An input form to receive the marks for your report card</li>
                <li>A job application form including necessary personal data along with other requirements an employer might need</li>
                <li>RPG Character Data Sheet</li>
            </ol>
            <b>Again, don't be too concerned with the layout; today is about adding in all of the necessary form fields that you need for your document. We will begin
                looking at layout and placement of content in the next lessons.
