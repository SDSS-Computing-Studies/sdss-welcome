    <div id="content">
        Take a look at this page.  It is a typical webpage with content
    </div>
    <input type="button" id="click" value="Now Click This Button">
    <div id="explanation">
        <font class="title">How does this work?</font><br>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                The document has 2 div tags, one that is identified as "content"
                and one that is identified as "explanation". Explanation has a
                style applied to it to make it invisible at the start.
            </li>
            <li>
                An event handler is created to wait for the page to load.
                The event handler listens for a click event on the button. Once
                the button is clicked, the function "update" is called
            </li>
            <li>
                In the update function, the target element (the one that we are 
                going to update the content for) is identified. This is the one 
                whose HTML content is going to be changed.
            </li>
            <li>
                We could write the changes directly, but we have a lot of
                text that we're going to add, so we are going to create 
                a variable to store the changes, and then add onto the 
                variable using the += operator
            </li>
            <li>
                Once we have our content stored in a variable, we'll assign 
                that directly to a property of our ID object, using the 
                "innerHTML" property
            </li>
            <li>
                Each style property is updated directly using variables.
                Sometimes, you'll need to hunt around to find out what the 
                name of the actual property you want to change is called,
                but some code editors like Microsoft Visual Studio Code can 
                help you with autocompletion and suggestions.
            </li>
            <li>
                The hidden block has its visibility style changed to make it visible!
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
