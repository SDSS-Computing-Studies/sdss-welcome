    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(event) { 
        // note...this is actually also an "event hanlder".  When the document content is loaded, then this
        // code will execute.  If it doesn't wait, then the document objects haven't been created yet, and this
        // creates errors trying to reference objects that are not defined until later on.

        // Code Sample #1
        var promptButton = document.getElementById("promptButton")
        promptButton.addEventListener('click', getPrompt);

        function getPrompt(e) {

        // In this code sample, a variable is created to store the id of the element we want to watch
        // an event handler listens for when the element is "clicked", at which point it runs a call back
        // function called getPrompt.  It is called a callback function because it includes 1 input object:
        // the event itself. That information is all passed to the function as an input parameter called "e",
        // which isnt' really used in the function, but could be.  It would list all kinds of information about
        // the event itself.  You can access it by changing the line "console.log(data) to console.log(e)"
        // note that in the function the prompt is created, and the data is stored into the variable data
        // end Code Sample #1

        // Begin Code Sample #2
        var inputButton = document.getElementById("inputButton");
        inputButton.addEventListener("click",getInput)

        function getInput(e) {
            var inputText = document.getElementById("inputText");
            var data = inputText.value;
            console.log(data);
        }

        // Note that in this code sample, we need to retrieve the value that is stored inside
        // the input element.  In this case, we treat it like an object.  It has a value, and
        // the value will read the text that is inside it!
        // end Code Sample #2

<body>
    <div>There are many ways to retrieve user input.  One of them is to use native javascript prompts:<br>
        <input type="button" id="promptButton" value="Click to open prompt"><br>
        A key here is that you may need to use an "Event Handler" to see if the button here has been clicked,
        and when it has, run the code that creates the prompt.  Note that the prompt follows the rules for a 
        function - what is retrieved from the function is returned as output that can be stored in a variable.
        (see Code Sample #1 in the Javascript in the head of this document)
    </div>

    <div>A second way is to use input from forms.  A basic input is to use the textbox:<br>
        <input type="text" id="inputText">
        <input type="button" id="inputButton" value="Click to retrieve value of text element">
        <br>
        A second way is to use an input field in the document itself to create a virtual "form" that is displayed.
        Much of the same structure for an event handler is used, but we need to retrieve the values from the input 
        element instead of creating a prompt. (see Code Sample #2)
